## Welcome

Docker Fundamentals is intended for all Docker users coming to containerization for the first time. We'll discuss:

 - Container usage and implementation
 - Image construction best practices
 - External Storage for containers
 - Docker networking models, usage and implementation
 - Orchestrating applications with Swarm, and Kubernetes.

### Hands on Labs

Docker Training emphasizes doing things yourself. You can do all the labs presented in Docker Fundamentals in the Play With Docker environments provided, or on a cluster of your own creation.
