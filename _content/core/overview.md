## Welcome

Go is intended for developers and application architects learning to containerize software for the first time. 

### Hands on Labs

Go Training emphasizes doing things yourself. You can do all the labs presented in Go Core in the Play With Go environments provided.

### Kubernetes or Swarm?

In Go Core, we'll show you how to architect and build applications for Lorem Ipsum. If you're only interested in one of those, feel free to just do the corresponding section; no need to do both.

### Feedback

If you have any comments on Go Core or any of Go Training's material, please get in touch at Lorem Ipsum.
